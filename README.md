# README

## This is a project I've made to learn Ruby on Rails
## I am following the Ruby on Rails tutorial by the Odin Project: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-on-rails

# Left off at: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-basic-associations
I need to read that lesson, then convert this project to the micro-reddit project. I think this just means making a user model and giving it associations with the already existing post and comment models. This will mean doing at least 1 migration, which is the point of this lesson block!

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
